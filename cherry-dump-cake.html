  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Amazingly easy and amazingly good... too good! This is my mother-in-law's recipe that was just recently shared. It
    would be a shame not to share it. Best served warm and with vanilla ice cream (of course).
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 (21 ounce) cans cherry pie filling</li>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
      Spread cherry pie filling over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Stir cake mix and butter together into a
      gooey, clumpy mixture. Break into pieces between your fingers and crumble evenly on top of the cherry filling.
      Sprinkle pecans on top.
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
